<h1>Hi, I'm Robin.<br/><a href="https://github.com/shindelr">Programmer and Data Analyst</a></h1>

<h2>Project Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
  
  <h3>Senior Capstone Software Development (Django, Selenium, AngularJS, Pandas)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>My team and I developed this project for <a href="https://www.agbizlogic.com">AgBiz Logic</a>. Our work resides under an NDA as this is an industry partner to                 Oregon State University.</li>
      <li>Developed a RESTful API Endpoint in Django.</li>
      <li>Implemented a fully automated Python script to grab a spreadsheet from Cornell University containing EIQ values and loaded them into a JSON using Pandas.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>Research & Data Processing</h3>
    <ul> 
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/shindelr/Nearshore-PIV">Swash Image Processing</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li> A tool built for Professor Greg Wilson's analysis of nearshore wave interactions on rocky coastlines. </li>
        <li> Originally built in MATLAB, I ported this software into Julia and modified it to fit the lab's specific purposes. Current benchmarking shows an average performance
        increase of 50% over the original. </li>
        <li> Includes the creation of a Julia & Python hybrid pipeline to feed TB's of images through the main Particle Image Velocimetry program.</li>
        <li> Visit the <a href="https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/wilsonlab/"> CIL lab webpage </a> for more details on this great research group. </li>
      </ul>           
    </ul>

  <h3>Scripting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/shindelr/scripts"> General Automation </a> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> These scripts are general command line applications built to simplify certain tasks that would be time consuming otherwise. </li>
          <li>Some of them are quite simple, such as `recently-downloaded`, which just moves the most  recently downloaded file on your computer to the current directory. 
          While trivial in implementation, this script was quite useful for school, where I spent a surprising amount of time moving files around and organizing assignments.</li>
          <li> `batchscript` was developed specifically for use in the Swash Image Processing project above but could be used in other contexts as well. The script creates a series of text files containing the absolute paths to files such as images. I used this to separate out batches equal to the number of processes I intended to use in image processing.   </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>Analytics & Machine Learning</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/shindelr/churn-analysis-406"> IBM Telco Customer Churn Analysis </a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive churn analysis report using the fictional IBM Telco telecommunications dataset.</li>
        <li>Key technologies used include GCP's BigQuery & Looker and Python for EDA, plotting, and statistical inference.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/shindelr/weather-ml-report"> Machine Learning for the Weather</li>
      <ul>
        <li> This repository contains source code, visualizations, and two lengthy documents exemplar of the data science lifecycle.</li>
        <li> Primarily uses Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to illustrate EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization practices.</li>
        <li> Models used were Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, Principle Component Analysis, Multiple Linear and Logistic Regressions, ensemble methods and more.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    
  <h3>Full Stack Applications & Cloud Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/shindelr/gcp-tarpaulin"> Tarpaulin Learning Management System </a></li>
        <ul>
          <li> A RESTful API making use of Google Cloud Platform technologies such as DataStore and File Storage.</li>
          <li> Fully implemented Authorization and Authentication using OAuth2.0 for secure endpoints.</li>
          <li> The application is intended as a rudimentary learning management system. Users can register or drop classes as a student, see which classes they're teaching as an instructor and even upload an avatar.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/shindelr/Session-Logger"> The Session Logger </a></li>
        <ul>
          <li> A fun project built for surfers wanting to log a diary of their surf sessions. Users simply enter the date and time when they were out in the water, and a rating out of 5-stars to be associated with it. The application then interfaces with the National Data Buoy Center's API to extract the realtime conditions the surfer would have experienced during their surf. This data is stored in a TSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure.</li>
          <li>The backend API and data processing business logic is built on Python with Flask.</li>
          <li>The application frontend is built on TypeScript with React.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/shindelr/TheAviators"> Private Jet Charter CRUD </a></li>
        <ul>
          <li> A full stack CRUD application providing an administrative interface for a fictional private jet chart company. </li>
          <li> Built fully on JavaScript, Node & Express, with a custom built relational database.</li>
          <li> The primary purpose of this project was to gain hands on experience normalizing a structured DB, writing out Entity Relationship Diagrams and engineering Schemas.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
  
</ul>
